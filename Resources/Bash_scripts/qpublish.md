# Continuous Publishing Pipeline

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the commit message is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a commit message."
  exit 1
fi

# Commit the changes with the provided message
git add .
git commit -m "$1"

# Push the changes to the main branch
git push origin main

# Publish to GitHub Pages using quarto
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render --no-prompt
```

## Explanation:

- The script checks if a commit message is provided. If not, it exits with an error message.

- It adds all changes (`git add .`), commits them with the provided message (`git commit -m "$1"`), and pushes the changes to the `main` branch (`git push origin main`).

- Finally, it publishes the Quarto website to GitHub Pages using `quarto publish gh-pages` with the `--no-render` and `--no-prompt` options.

## Components of the If Statement

- **`if`**: This keyword begins the conditional statement.

- **`[ -z "$1" ]`**: This is the condition being evaluated.
  
  - **`[ ]`**: These are test brackets, which are used to enclose the condition. The space between the brackets and the condition is crucial.
  - **`-z`**: This is a test operator that checks if the string that follows is empty. It returns `true` if the string is empty and `false` otherwise.
  - **`"$1"`**: This refers to the first command-line argument passed to the script. The double quotes around `$1` ensure that the argument is treated as a single word, even if it contains spaces.

- **`then`**: This keyword indicates the start of the code block that will be executed if the condition is true.

## Square Brackets (`[ ]`)

Square brackets are used as a synonym for the `test` command in Bash. They are primarily used for evaluating expressions and conditions within `if` statements and loops. Here are some key points about their usage:

- **Test Constructs**: Square brackets are commonly used in `if` statements to evaluate conditions. For example, `[ "$VAR" -eq 2 ]` checks if the variable `VAR` is equal to 2

- **Syntax Requirements**: There must be spaces between the brackets and the expression inside them. For example, `[ "$name" = 'Bob' ]` is valid, whereas `[ "$name"='Bob' ]` is not s

- **Single vs. Double Brackets**: Single square brackets (`[ ]`) are used for basic tests, while double square brackets (`[[ ]]`) offer more advanced features like pattern matching and regular expressions.

## Semicolon (`;`)

The semicolon in Bash scripting is used to separate commands on the same line. It acts as a command delimiter, allowing multiple commands to be executed sequentially. Here’s how it works:

- **Command Separation**: When you want to execute multiple commands in sequence on a single line, you can separate them with a semicolon. For example:bash
  
  `echo "Hello"; echo "World"`
  This will execute both `echo` commands one after the other.

- **In Conditional Statements**: In `if` statements, a semicolon can be used before the `then` keyword when writing the entire condition on a single line:bash
  
  `if [ "$name" = 'Bob' ]; then echo "Hello Bob"; fi`
  Here, the semicolon separates the condition from the action to be taken if the condition is true.
